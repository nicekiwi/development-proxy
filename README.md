# Development Proxy

Simple development proxy to intercept specified files and load local files instead.

## Requirements

- `Node.js` >= 6.9.0.
- `OpenSSL` installed.

## Install

`npm install`

## Config

`./config.josn`

## Setup SSL

Most sites should be using SSL by now, so we use SSL proxy by default.

A key and certificate were created for you during installation. If you do not see them in `./pems`, run `npm install` again.

### Trust the Certificate
